And the Master Sword sleeps again...
forever...


Or, at least, that was the plan.



After saving the world, Zelda and
Link returned to their lives.
And yet, things were not right for young Zelda

She is a princess, and as such, she will have
to inherit Hyrule. Yet, the adventures she 
sharedwith Link still lingers in her mind. 
Somehow, she yearns for the friendship they had.
Unknown to everyone, she began to learn some
powerfull magic, to be able to escape the 
castle.


With her new powers, she began to visit Link
in his house, to talk to him.
His "peasant life" is something she never knew..
and yet, he was the old hero that Hyrule had.
He had done so much more for her kingdom than
anyone, and yet... his glory was nothing more
than a mere thanks for the King.

Link, I'm sorry...
I couldn't save you...


Agahnim's magic is way too strong for me...



But there's still a way. You'll have to
trust me.
There's a forbidden magic that binds two people
together.
It's way too dangerous to do. Only royal people
know of its existence.
Our souls are bound now.

Now, you'll wake up. And we'll be together all
the time.
Let's go to the wise man in Kakariko Village.
He'll know what to do.
For now on, we're together...
